# Joe's Tweaks

If you like my stuff, feel free buy me a coffee (or a beer) at ko-fi.com/joeownage

These are my personal tweaks to several mods (if they are loaded) I use for my playthroughs, which I'm sure will get added to over time. Only requires Harmony and Vanilla Expanded Framework.

For RPG Flavour extensive rename of literally everything in Rimworld, including Vanilla Psycasts Expanded schools of magic, plus some bonus content, check out RPG Flavour Pack Forked:

[h1]Tweaks[/h1]

[b]Boozing for Psyfocus[/b] 
- All alcoholic beverages from Core Rimworld, Medieval Overhaul, House Roxmont, Mashed's Ashlands, and Stoneborn Delights will restore 5% psyfocus (mana) if Rimworld: Royalty is loaded.

[b]MEDIEVAL OVERHAUL and VFE: MEDIEVAL 2[/b] 
(I recommend also using my [b]Medieval Overlap Remover[/b] mod when combining these two)
- Adds Lore Merchant trader caravan that sells all Medieval Overhaul books, but will not always have them all available.
- Adds Beast Hunter Reagent Merchant that sells reagents for MO alchemy and VFEM2 alchemy.
- Adds Arcane Merchant that sells eltex stuff, gems, etc (requires Royalty).
- Adds Chirurgical Limbwright trader caravan that sells medicine and reagents (prosthetics also if Medieval Medicine: MO Edition is loaded).
- Grimoires will appear in lootable bookshelves in Medieval Overhaul hideouts and ruins. (Requires Grimoires mod)
- Added ability to mine raw mithril (plasteel) at Medieval Overhaul mine. (Refining at furnace requires DankPyon_Plasteel research from MO)
- Added ability to mine raw oricalcum (uranium) at Medieval Overhaul mine.
- Added recipe to refine Oricalcum into ingots at Medieval Overhaul furnace. (Requires DankPyon_Plasteel research from MO)
- Added ability to mine raw pyrinth at Medieval Overhaul mine. (Requires Epochs: Pyrinth)
- Nerfed the amount of tanning liquor the Medieval Overhaul tanning rack uses.
- Clay chunks now are cut into pieces for the kiln, then fired to create blocks.
- Increased path cost of low castle wall so that raiders and colonists will prefer to go around it instead of over it. I want it to function like a battlements and it's pretty much useless if raiders can just walk right over it.

[b][CZK] EYE PROSTHETICS (CONTINUED)[/b]
- Adjusted research to align with Medieval Overhaul.
- Changed regular eyepatch recipe use either cloth or Medieval Overhaul's linen.
- Changed glass eye recipe to use glass from Rebuild: Doors and Corners (Requires Rebuild: Doors and Corners).
- Changed tribal eyepatch recipe use any leather instead of just light leather.

[b]MEDIEVAL MEDICINES: MEDIEVAL OVERHAUL EDITION[/b]
- Removed eye patch if [CZK] Eye Prosthetics (Continued) is loaded.

[b]ARCANE ARCAEOLOGISTS CONTINUED[/b]
- Corrected improper layering of capes that has existed since the original mod using code provided by Airo. Thanks!

[b]Medieval Overhaul: Royalty[/b]
- patched mediation throne and simple throne to both satisfy lower tier throne requirements
- patched simple throne to only require complex furniture research

[b]Royalty DLC[/b]
- made ideogram stuffable

[b]Biotech DLC[/b]
- buffed work speed of first tier mechs

[b]Campfire Stews[/b]
- Campfire stews no longer adds a new clay type if Medieval Overhaul is loaded.
- Campfire stews already supports MO clay and many other clay types.

[b]Big and Small: Vampires and the Undead[/b]
- Made infection from vampire bites less agressive.

[b]Vanilla Races Expanded: Sanguophage[/b]
- VRE: Sanguophage xenotypes won't spawn naturally.
- if Big and Small: Vampires and Undead is loaded, extends corpsefeeder/animalfeeder/sanguofeeder to those xenotypes.

[b]AnyPlant[/b]
- made certain plants plantable in the AnyPlant planter that are reasonable to grow inside in a pot and may even perform better there.
